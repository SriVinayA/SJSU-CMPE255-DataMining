# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques Colab Notebook

This repository contains the assignment solution files for various dimensionality reduction techniques applied to different datasets.

## Notebook Overview

### 1. Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
This Colab notebook is designed to demonstrate the application and effectiveness of various dimensionality reduction techniques on different datasets.

#### Techniques Covered:
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)
- Isometric Mapping (ISOMap)
- Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)
- Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)
- t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

#### Key Features:
- Detailed implementation of each technique.
- Comparative analysis on where each technique works effectively and where it does not.
- Visualization of results for each technique.
- Guidance on selecting hyperparameters for each method.
- UMAP visualizations with screenshots included.

#### References:
- Inspired by examples from [Hands-On ML3](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3/blob/main/08_dimensionality_reduction.ipynb).
- Additional insights from [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/11-dimensionality-reduction-techniques-you-should-know-in-2021-dcb9500d388b).

### 2. Application of UMAP and Clustering
This section of the notebook illustrates how UMAP can be used for dimensionality reduction followed by clustering and as a feature extraction technique for classification.

#### Key Concepts:
- Integration of UMAP with clustering techniques.
- Feature extraction using UMAP for classification tasks.
