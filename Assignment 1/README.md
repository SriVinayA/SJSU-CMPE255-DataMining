## Introduction
UFO sightings have always been a topic of intrigue and speculation. This analysis dives deep into the dataset to uncover patterns, and trends, and predict the duration of these sightings using machine learning models.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises reported UFO encounters with attributes like location, shape, and duration. It offers a detailed account of these sightings and forms the basis for our predictive models.

## Analysis Highlights
- Exploration of the most frequent UFO shapes reported.
- Distribution of sightings based on geographical location.
- Seasonal trends in UFO sightings.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for machine learning.

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Regression

## Conclusions
While the models provided insights into the duration of UFO sightings, they also highlighted the unpredictable nature of such phenomena. The analysis underscores the importance of data preprocessing, outlier handling, and model selection.
