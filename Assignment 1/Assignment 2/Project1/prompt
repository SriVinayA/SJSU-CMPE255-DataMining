Design a simple web application named "Recipe Finder" with the following functionalities:

html:
The main page should have a title "Recipe Finder".
Provide a search input box and a button to initiate the search.
Display the search results in a grid format. Each item in the grid should display an image of the recipe, the name of the recipe, a short description (or instruction snippet), and a "Read More" link.
Implement a "Load More" button to fetch more recipes.
Add responsive design to accommodate different device sizes.
Incorporate a visually hidden loader that appears during data fetching.

javascript:
The backend (in this case, client-side JavaScript) should handle the search query.
Use the API endpoint: https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php with parameters for search and pagination.
Implement error handling for API requests.

css:
Use muted colors for the background and blue shades for interactive elements.
Ensure smooth transitions for hover effects.
Utilize modern CSS practices for layout and design.
