# Assignment 1: AutoML with JADBio

## Introduction
In the realm of medical datasets, the complexity and sheer volume of data can be overwhelming. Recognizing this challenge, for the first segment of our assignment, we turned to JADBio, a specialized AutoML platform tailored for medical datasets. This platform not only simplifies the data discovery process but also ensures that the insights drawn are both meaningful and actionable.

Our journey with JADBio allowed us to delve deep into our dataset, extracting patterns and insights that might have been overlooked with traditional methods. 

For those who prefer a more visual representation, we've prepared a [screencast](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1owO1TtGnZZFLwZcuVTWPufPzn_xZzRAn/view?usp=sharing) that walks you through our workflow, methodologies, and the results we've achieved.

## Datasets
Our exploration was based on a dataset we sourced from Kaggle, a renowned platform for machine learning and data science projects.

# Assignment 2: PyCaret

## Introduction
The world of data science is rapidly evolving, with tools like PyCaret and Gradio leading the charge in the low-code revolution. In this segment of our assignment, we embraced these tools to perform data mining with minimal coding effort.

Our objective was clear: select a dataset from Kaggle, implement it in PyCaret's colabs, run the analysis, and present the outputs. Throughout this process, we made sure to harness the full AutoML capabilities of PyCaret, ensuring a comprehensive and in-depth analysis.

## Datasets
For this segment, we once again turned to Kaggle to source a dataset that would be both challenging and insightful for our analysis.
