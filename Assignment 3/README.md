# Assignment Overview

This assignment focuses on the application of three renowned data science methodologies: CRISP-DM, SEMMA, and KDD. For each methodology, participants are expected to:

1. Undertake a comprehensive project that encompasses every stage of the selected methodology.
2. Utilize in-depth guidance from ChatGPT/GPT-4 to ensure comprehensive coverage of each stage and its respective subtasks.
3. Manually review and refine any ChatGPT-generated code, then adapt the project into a Google Colab notebook.
4. Craft a Medium article detailing the project's journey and outcomes.

Additionally, for every methodology:
- Source unique datasets from places such as Kaggle or [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/datasetsLinks).
- Adhere meticulously to the steps of the chosen methodology.
- Compile a Medium article for the project.
- Produce a research paper in both LaTeX and PDF formats, aiming for Arxiv submission.
- Generate a comprehensive report, encapsulating the entire analysis from inception to deployment. If utilizing the ChatGPT GPT-4 data analysis plugin, ensure detailed responses for each section and validate them, infusing your creativity where appropriate.
